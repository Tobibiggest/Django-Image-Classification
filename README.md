# Django-Image-Classification
The Dog Breed Identification project integrates Django with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to develop a web application that can accurately predict a dog's breed from an uploaded image. This tool aims to assist pet owners, veterinarians, shelters, and dog buyers in identifying dog breeds quickly and accurately.
